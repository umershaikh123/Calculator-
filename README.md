# Calculator-Project
 ### Execute the main file to run the program
 -The important thing about this project is hard logic about how calculations are being performed with my own algorithm</br>
 I have broken the files into simple calculations and Scientific Calculations between 2 ,3, 4, 5 , infinite number inputs</br>
 Simple Calculations can only perform normal + , - , x , / </br>
 Scientific Calculations can perform Scientific functions as well like Trignometry , power and log function </br>
